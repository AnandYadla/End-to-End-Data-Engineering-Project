</div>

Introduction:
This project demonstrates an End-to-End Data Engineering pipeline for real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka. The project involves ingesting, processing, and analyzing real-time data streams, leveraging various technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and SQL.

Architecture:

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Amazon Web Services (AWS):
- S3 (Simple Storage Service): For data storage
- Athena: For querying data
- Glue Crawler: For data cataloging
- Glue Catalog: For managing metadata
- EC2: For deploying Kafka and other services
- Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming and processing

Dataset Used:
- We are focusing on the operational side of data engineering, specifically building data pipelines. For this purpose, the dataset indexProcessed.csv is used. However, any similar dataset can be employed to achieve the same objectives.

Project Setup:
- Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-directory
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up AWS services:

Configure S3 bucket for data storage:
- Create and configure Glue Crawler and Glue Catalog.
- Set up Athena for SQL querying.
- Deploy Apache Kafka.
- Use AWS EC2 to deploy and manage Kafka clusters.

Run the project:
bash
Copy code
python your_main_script.py
Usage

Data Ingestion:
- Kafka is used to ingest real-time stock market data into the system.
Data Processing:
- The data is processed and stored in AWS S3.

Data Querying:
- Athena is used to query the data, leveraging the Glue Catalog for metadata management.
Conclusion:
- This project provides a comprehensive overview of building a real-time data engineering pipeline using industry-standard tools and technologies. It showcases the integration of various AWS services with Apache Kafka to manage and analyze real-time data effectively.
